VocalEyes will be a device/wearable that will include a camera and a speaker module. The major goal of the VocalEyes is to help the visually impaired. The visual eyes will recognize an object that the user directsit at (via the camera module) and will output audio information (via the speaker module) about what the object is. (eg: in case of text it will readout the text).
